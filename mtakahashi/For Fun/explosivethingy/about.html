			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>
				Each one of my games a re a bit different, but feel free to suggest any type of game. I work very hard on them, so please do not rush me. My top two games have hit trending and top-loved. Each game is included in the Games Playlist, however due to the fact that not all are good I have included a data list containing the link, title, quality, and share date of each project.
