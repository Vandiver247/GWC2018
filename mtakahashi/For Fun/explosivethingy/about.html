			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>
				Each one of my games are a bit different, but feel free to suggest any type of game. Each game is included in the Games Studio, in which I have included a data list containing the link, title, quality, and share date of each project.

			<h2>Engines</h2>
			<p>
				I make many engines by request and also for fun. My engines include a simple text engine, sound visualizer engine, and a platformer engine with which you can create your own platformer without any code. Though engines are fun to make, I may not always be able to complete all requests because of the time they take up.

			<h2>Community</h2>
			<p>
				The large community has often supported me and my projects for a long time. Each follow, love and fave means a lot to me! If you have a question or request, comment on my profile and I'll respond.
