        <h4> Coincidence, I Think Not</h4>
        <p>Now you may think, "Hmm... ok now 
        I know about all these clubs?? It's 
        just a coincidence they all start
        with girls." That's where you are wrong 
        my friend. This is not a coincidence. 
        This is for girls to step up to the 
        table. We should try the things people
        tell us only boys can do or play. We
        need to show them who we really are.
        
        PEACE OUT GIRL SCOUT!! see what I idid there
