        <h4> Coincidence, I Think Not</h4>
        <p>Now you may think, "Hmm... ok now 
        I know about all these clubs?? It's 
        just a coincidence they all start
        with girls." That's where you are wrong <br/>
        my friend. This is not a coincidence. 
        This is for girls to step up to the 
        table. We should try the things people
        tell us only boys can do or play. We<br/>
        need to show them who we really are.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        PEACE OUT GIRL SCOUT!! See what I did there??

        <h4>Now Now...There's more...</h4>
        <p>Okay. Now that you have all this knowledge,
        what are you supposed to do with it? Down below 
        is a form you can sign out to possibly enroll in <br/>
        one or maybe all of those clubs.</p>
